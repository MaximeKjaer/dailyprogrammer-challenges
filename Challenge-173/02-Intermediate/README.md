#[Challenge #173 Intermediate - Advanced Langton's Ant](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2c4ka3/7302014_challenge_173_intermediate_advanced/)

I thought that this one would be really hard, but honestly, the hardest thing was installing Pillow - here's some advice for everyone else doing this challenge: keep your head cool, break it into smaller challenges, don't be scared to use many variables to describe the ant's progress...

A big thank you to /u/Ultimate_Timmeh - he taught me to use a modulo whenever I have an index that needs to roll over (rather than an ```Ã¬f``` statement).

Also, this on is in Python 3.4 (for once!).
